# Setup New Dataset

I'll help you download and set up a new customer feedback dataset.

**Vertical requested**: $1

Let me guide you through:

1. **Search Kaggle** for relevant datasets in this vertical
2. **Download** the dataset to the appropriate location
3. **Validate** the schema and structure
4. **Document** the dataset in the appropriate docs
5. **Create sample queries** for testing

Please provide the vertical name (e.g., airlines, delivery, ecommerce, telecom, reviews, social-media, retail) or describe what kind of feedback data you're looking for.
